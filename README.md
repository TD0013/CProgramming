# CProgramming
This Repository contains my Term Project for the Course "C Programming" for which I developed a game similar to the gamee show "Who wants to be a Millionare".

## Description of how to run the code and observe the output:
The executable is called 2019B5PS0636P_P5.exe. It is a KBC game created using C.
 When you run the exe, If will prompt you to hit enter to continue.
 It will then display the in game ReadMe, the stats and the first question with a prompt for a response.
As this is a coding assignment, we made sure that the questions are simple so that the evaluator can focus more on the code.
All questions have 4 options: A,B,C and D and only one correct answer.
All answers are case sensitive.Eg if the answer is A, a is not acceptable.
To use 50-50 lifeline, type ”Lifeline1”(case sensitive). This will display a statement telling the user about 2 answers which are incorrect, followed by a prompt for a response.
To use Flip the question lifeline, type ”Lifeline2”(case sensitive). This will change the question displayed and give a prompt for response.
You can use both lifelines in one question.
Lifelines can only be used once.
The user can quit at any point by typing ”Quit” and exit with the money won till that point.
The user can type “ReadMe”(case sensitive) to read the instructions at any point in game. Typing “ReadMe” will display the instructions and can be used as many times the user wants.
The Game Ends if you enter a wrong answer and you fall down to the last intermediate question ie 3,8,12.
You win the game if you answer all answers correctly.
